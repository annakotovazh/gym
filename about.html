        <article>
            <p>We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City, Chermside, Graceville and
                Westlake.</p> 
                <p>ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout
                the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and improving
                your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your goal is weight loss, body building,
                nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy, or just looking and feeling better - we're here for
                you!</p>
                <p>ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including group fitness classes and one-on-one
                    personal training sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing and karate. Our trainers are all
                    Les Mills accredited instructors and are second to none â€“ all have Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements.</p>
                <p>We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym
                    world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for
                    themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility than
                    something that a marketing machine dreams up. You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at
                    your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling
                    you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing changefrom that. Our 'no obligation, no
                    pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.</p>
                   <p>We have created gyms that we would
                love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old
                school feel with a new school attitude!We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays,
                weekends & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time.
                If you need a late night workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for
                you. Our class times change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable at each of our
                clubs.</p>
