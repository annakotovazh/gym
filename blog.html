                <p> 
                    Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing.
                    I competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my
                    knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump
                    into the ring as your sparring partner.<br>
                    For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing scene.
                    He has competed as an amateur in his early years and now shares his
                    knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his boxing classes with
                    passion and enthusiasm.<br>
                    The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun,
                    exciting and highly energised.<br>
                    Whether it is your first class or you're
                    an intermediate level boxer, you will gain a lot by becoming involved.
                    It is one of the best cardiovascular workouts available</p>
